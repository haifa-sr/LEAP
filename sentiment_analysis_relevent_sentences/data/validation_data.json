{"text":"Here a peculiar mating threat, which occurs not infrequently in practical play, keeps the Black Queen tied to her f7 and unavailable for the protection of the B at c8. ","label":0}
{"text":"The calculation is perfectly simple upon the following lines: I play e5, then my pawn is attacked by a pawn and two Knights, a Bishop and two Rooks, six times in all. ","label":1}
{"text":"This established, he can embark on the advance of the e Pawn without any fear. ","label":2}
{"text":"Apparently from the point of view of quick development only e4 and d4 need be considered, since they free both Bishop and Queen, whilst other pawn moves liberate one piece only. ","label":2}
{"text":"It is therefore necessary to play c3 first. ","label":2}
{"text":"The pawn at c6 supports an advance in the centre, and also provides a retreat for the Bishop. ","label":2}
{"text":"After the first few moves we arrive at the following position, which may be reached thus: 3. Bb5 d6 4. d4 Bd7 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. O-O Be7 7. Re1 exd4 8. Nxd4 O-O. ","label":1}
{"text":"Instead of 4. e3 White should play g3 and develop his B at g2. ","label":2}
{"text":"It now only remains for us to discover whether Black has any other answer to d4 which would necessitate close analysis on White's part. ","label":1}
{"text":"Furthermore, Black has relinquished the square d5 and made e5 the basis of operations. ","label":2}
{"text":"Many openings in which neither e4 nor d4 is the first move lead to wellknown positions by a simple transposition of moves. ","label":1}
{"text":"For instance, a Queen's gambit may well have the following opening moves: 1. c4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. e3 d5 5. d4 or a French defence these: 1. Nc3 d5 2. d4 Nf6 3. Bh5 e6 4. e4 There are, of course, systems of opening which deviate absolutely from those which have been proved sound and are in general use, and it is those openings that puzzle the beginner most of all. ","label":2}
{"text":"16. Ne4 Bb7 17. Nxd6 (not Bxa7 because of BxB 18. Nxd6 Bxg2 followed by Qg4+) cxd6 18. Rd1 and c5. ","label":2}
{"text":"White's d4 the basis of his centre, is entirely in his hands, whilst Black's d5 is exposed to a steady pressure by the White pieces. ","label":2}
{"text":"Finally Black's b8 is unfavourably placed, obstructing as it does the c7 and preventing its falling into line with its fellows. ","label":0}
{"text":"The more usual continuation for White is 4. Ba4 Nc6 5. O-O he does not trouble to protect his e Pawn as its capture would allow his Rook an open file on which to act against the opposing King (compare Games Nos. ","label":2}
{"text":"14 and 17) 5. ... Be7. Now Black can capture the e Pawn without much risk, as the Bishop is on the King's file. ","label":2}
{"text":"White could also obtain a rapid development by Nc3, d3, Be3 or Ng5, but this arrangement is not popular, because Black can play Na5 and exchange the valuable B. ","label":3}
{"text":"Black, however, must try to round off his pawn position on the Queen's side, by moving his c Pawn into line. ","label":2}
{"text":"Diagram 40 gives the position reached after: 3. Nf3 e6 4. e3 Nf5 5. Ne5 Nf6 White would not accomplish much with 6. f4. The more or less symmetrical lineup of the pieces would most likely lead to a draw after Black properly prepares freeing his hemmed-in Bishop with b6 and Bb7. ","label":0}
{"text":"A better plan would be 6. f3, preventing Ne4 and preparing the eventual advance of the King's Pawn to e4. ","label":2}
{"text":"White, on the other hand, can bring out his B before playing e3, in this way: 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 and the game might proceed as follows: 4. ... Nd7. (Diagram 38.) ","label":2}
{"text":"Black would be justified in playing 2. ... dxc4, and so furthering White's object of getting his (Black's) Queen's Pawn away, if he could permanently hold the gambit pawn, or if the giving up of the square at d5 fits into a reasoned system of development. ","label":2}
{"text":"This forces the Bishop to move twice, and Black regains the move he lost in his development, when he played dxc4. ","label":2}
{"text":"If Black plays instead: 5. ... c6 White wins back his pawn with 6. b3 cxb3 7. axb5 cxb5 8. Bxb5+ by Qxb3 and moreover is much ahead with his development. ","label":3}
{"text":"Now the King's Pawn is attacked twice. ","label":0}
{"text":"It would be bad to support it with Nc6, as White would exchange pawns and then Queens. ","label":0}
{"text":"Since it seems impossible to protect the King's Pawn, the only alternative would be to exchange it; indeed it is on the whole the best course, although it allows a White piece to take up a dominating position in the centre. ","label":2}
{"text":"Nf6 7. Qb3 Qe7 Black cannot cover his King's Bishop's Pawn with Qd7 because 8. Qxf7 wins the Rook, whilst now Black could play 8. ... Qb4+ in reply, forcing the exchange of Queens. ","label":2}
{"text":"But in view of the fact that Black's game is wholly undeveloped, and that he plays practically several pieces down, White sacrifices his Knight for two pawns: he foresees the position which occurs a few moves later, when Black is hemmed in on all sides. ","label":3}
{"text":"Black keeps the upper hand in these early encounters because he has made a developing move with a piece, whilst White has played a pawn move which is useless for the purpose of development. ","label":1}
{"text":"The following line of play would fulfil this condition: 1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 d4 Black thereby abandons the gambit pawn. ","label":1}
{"text":"d6 must also be played in order to mobilise the Queen's Bishop, leaving e7 as the only square for the King's Bishop finally the \"backward\" pawn ","label":2}
{"text":"The best plan for Black is to decline the doubtful gift of the pawn and to bring about one of the positions, as sketched above, in which, by playing d5 early in the game, Black is sure of the free development of all his forces. ","label":2}
{"text":"With this move White at once attacks the Black e Pawn, though indirectly, by threatening to exchange the B for the N. ","label":2}
{"text":"To make the capture effective, however, White must first protect his own King's Pawn, which would otherwise be lost after 4. Bxc6 bxc6 5. Nxe5 Qd4!. ","label":3}
{"text":"Broadly speaking, two entirely different systems of defence can be distinguished: either Black will try to maintain his centre pawn, or else, giving up the centre, try to gain some other advantage as compensation. ","label":1}
{"text":"For if in that case Black exchanges the Knights, he only furthers White's development without doing anything towards strengthening his d5. ","label":0}
{"text":"Nc5 would therefore seem to be the best choice, as the B becomes mobile again after White's Bc2 nor can White play d4 as yet. ","label":2}

{"text":"The obvious moves to this end are: for White the advance of the f4 Pawn, for Black that of the c Pawn and sometimes even of the b Pawn, that is when the c5 Pawn has not been exchanged for the opposing d4 Pawn, but has pushed on to c4. ","label":2}
{"text":"Supposing White plays after 1. d4 d5 2. c4 ","label":1}
{"text":"His aim is to tempt Black's centre pawn away and to make his c5 and e5 accessible for his own forces. ","label":1}
{"text":"Meanwhile Black gains time for concentrating his forces for an attack which wins the Queen's Pawn. ","label":2}
{"text":"To play b3 before castling is very dangerous, because Black can play cxd4 and pin the White QKt with Bb4 forcing Bd2 when Bb2 was the move intended, ","label":0}
{"text":"A developing move can be interpolated, e.g. 3. Nc3 Nf6. ","label":2}
{"text":"While White's development is easy and natural, Black has difficulty in finding good places for his King's side pieces. ","label":3}
{"text":"A certain compensation lies in the fact that White's attacking King's Bishop has been exchanged. ","label":2}
{"text":"Except the French defence and the Caro-Kann, there is no game in which an irregular reply to White's 1. e4 necessitates any special considerations either in development of pieces or pawn formation. ","label":0}

{"text":"In this position, too, there is ample scope for the study of the opposition.","label":1}
{"text":"If the White P was not isolated but standing, for instance, at b2, Black would be lost, as calculation easily shows. ","label":2}
{"text":"Then after the reply Kc5, White is still unable to cut the opponent off from the corner with Kb7, as the loss of the pawn is still threatened through Kb4. ","label":0}

{"text":"1. Kg6 Kc8 2. Kf6 Ke8 3. Ke6 Kd8 4. Kd6 Kc8 5. c5 Kd8. We see: Black has just assumed the opposition, but the pawn has not yet crossed to his sixth square, and White, by playing c6, again forces Black to give up the opposition. ","label":2}
{"text":"In Diagram 80 White can still draw, for in five moves the pawn reaches b7, supported by the King at a7, and in that time Black cannot come up with his King, so that he must give up the Rook for the pawn. ","label":1}
{"text":"Therefore White must try to bring about the same position with Black to move. ","label":2}
{"text":"In spite of the preponderance of material, the win is not an easy one for Black, because of White's alarming pawn array on the Queen's side. ","label":0}

{"text":"5. ... Kc6 6. Bd4 Ra2+ 7. Ke3 Rxh2 8. Kf4 Rd2 9. g4 Rxd4 Black reduces the position to an elementary ending, which is theoretically a win. ","label":2}

{"text":"White plays therefore: 1. Qe5+ Ka8 2. Qa1+ Kb8 3. Qa5 and wins. ","label":2}
{"text":"In order to force the mate it is necessary to obtain command of four squares, namely, those four squares which he controls after he has been driven into a corner. ","label":2}
{"text":"Therefore it is necessary for White still to have such forces as can command two more squares of different colour, namely, a1 and b1. ","label":2}
